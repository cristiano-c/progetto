# Project 15/16 - _IFThisThenThat_
This project is part of the exam of the course of _Applicazioni Internet_.

## Project summary
The purpose of the  project is – for the students – to learn how to plan, set up and deploy a web based application and to experience how to solve problems using methods, algorithms and techniques taught in class (Java, HTML and JavaScript). The students have to conduct a joint teamwork to reach the **goal**.

## The **goal**
The goal of this project is to set up a web application similar to [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/recipes), includind the most important aspect of any web application: the combination of the client and server sides wich their proper aspects and properties, many related between them. 

### 1. The server side
  * a main server engine ([Spring](https://spring.io/tools) application context)
  * database management ([Hibernate](http://hibernate.org)/[MySql](https://www.mysql.it))
  * security adn authentication ([Spring security](https://spring.io/tools))
  * client restful data communication

### 2. The client side
  * a main client engine ([AngularJS](https://angularjs.org))
  * a clean and simple interface (mainy [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) but also some cute JavaScript third part library)
  * server restful data communication

### 3. The teamwork side
  * team communication: [Slack](https://slack.com) (and some bots)
  * continuous integration: [GitHub](https://github.com)
